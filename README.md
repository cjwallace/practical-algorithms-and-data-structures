# Practical Algorithms and Data Structures

Porting Bradfield School of Computer Science's [Practical Algorithms and Data Structures](https://bradfieldcs.com/algos/) to TypeScript. That book is subject to a Creative Commons license, and the content of this repo is licensed in kind.

I have stuck reasonably close (but certainly not 100%) to the spirit of the Python implementations provided. But TypeScript is not Python, and I certainly have not matched expression-for-expression. For-examle: I had to make some typing decisions that are not necessary in the Python version, and insert type guards to accommodate static types.
