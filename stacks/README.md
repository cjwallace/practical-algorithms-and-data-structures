# stacks

A simple stack.
This differs from that implemented in Practical Algorithms and Data Structures: the stack implemented here is homogenous.
It can accept any type of object, but only objects of one type.
In contrast, the stack in the book is heterogenous - it will accept mixed types of items.
Sticking with a homogenous stack gives us easy type safety through TypeScript, and we can still solve the exercises in the book.
